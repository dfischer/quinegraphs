# Quine graphs

Given a graph rewrite system, any graph has at least one maximal  collections of non-conflicting matches (MNCM) of left patterns of graphs rewrites. A graph G is a quine graph if it has a non-void MNCM such that after the rewrites from the collection are done in parallel we obtain a graph isomorphic with G. 

We invite you to  explore some of their properties, with examples taken from lambda calculus, interaction combinators and [chemlambda](https://github.com/chorasimilarity/chemlambda-gui/blob/gh-pages/dynamic/README.md).
